Review all previous output from previous steps.

Create a new, technically-focused README with these sections:
- Project Overview (What it does and why it exists)
- Technical Architecture
- Key Features
- Integration Points
- Non-obvious Configuration/Setup
- Notable Technical Considerations

Write your final README into ./output/step_09_output.md.

Keep the content technical and concise.
Skip obvious development practices or basic tool usage.
Avoid redundant summaries or AI-generation notes.

DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILE OTHER THAN ./output/step_09_output.md.
