Analyze the repository code and determine its SPECIFIC PURPOSE. 

Focus on:
1. What PROBLEM does this code solve?
2. What is the MAIN FUNCTIONALITY (not the technical structure)?

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Avoid generic technical descriptions and buzzwords
- Be specific about what the code actually does
- Prioritize analyzing main classes and entry points 

Write a concise explanation of the repository's purpose in plain language.

Write your findings in markdown format to ./output/step_01_output.md.
