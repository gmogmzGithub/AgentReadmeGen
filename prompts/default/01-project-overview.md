We are creating a high quality readme for this repository.

Look at the current README.md if it exists. Also look at typical project related files such as package.json, pyproject.toml, gradle or maven configuration, etc. Note any information that relates to these sections:

- Project Overview
- API Reference
- Features
- Installation
- Usage
- Testing
- Contact/Support Information

Write your findings in markdown format to ./output/step_01_output.md.

DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILE OTHER THAN ./output/step_01_output.md.

DO NOT suggest updates to the README.md file.

You can ask me to include any files that aren't already added to the context.
