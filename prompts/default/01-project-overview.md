We are creating a technical README for engineers and developers who understand standard development practices and internal company libraries.

Analyze the repository's code, configuration files, and structure to determine:
- Core purpose and functionality
- Key technical decisions
- Main architectural components
- Integration points with other systems

Focus on WHAT this repository does and WHY it exists from a technical perspective.
Avoid documenting obvious development practices or basic tool usage.

Write your findings in markdown format to ./output/step_01_output.md.

DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILE OTHER THAN ./output/step_01_output.md.

DO NOT suggest updates to the README.md file.

You can ask me to include any files that aren't already added to the context.
