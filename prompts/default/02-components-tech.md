Review all previous output from previous steps.

Analyze the project's technical components and infrastructure. Document:
- Primary programming languages used
- Key frameworks and their versions
- Notable dependencies and libraries
- Development tools and build systems
- Runtime requirements and environments
- Configuration settings from YAML/YML files (including CI/CD, deployment, and application configs)

Pay special attention to:
1. YAML configuration files (.yml, .yaml) which may contain crucial deployment, CI/CD, or application settings
2. Build configuration files (like gradle, maven, npm)
3. Docker-related files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
4. Environment configuration

Write your findings in markdown format to ./output/step_02_output.md.

DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILE OTHER THAN ./output/step_02_output.md.

You can ask me to include any files that aren't already added to the context.
